# Escrow wallet

Escrow Wallet is a TON blockchain-based application that helps build up a target amount, removing the possibility of changing one's mind along the way.

## You choose:

🎯 The savings target, for example 1,000 USDT.

⏳ The contribution interval, for example once per week.

💰 The fixed deposit amount, for example 100 USDT.

The deposit must be made at any time within each weekly interval, but only once per interval.
You cannot deposit an amount greater than the regular deposit in order to reach the goal faster.
If you do not make at least one deposit in time, the entire accumulated amount is lost.
After 70 days, the full accumulated amount is returned to your wallet in its entirety.

The application operates on the blockchain The Open Network, ensuring transparency, security, and full automation of the rules.

Both the native TON token and non-native tokens such as USDT or USDE are supported.
